          <p>A homelab is a personal IT environment that allows you to
          test, experiment, and learn about various technologies. It is
          usually a home-based setup where you can configure servers,
          networks, and various services.</p>

          <hr />
          <p>By hosting these services on my homelab, I gain greater
          control, privacy, and flexibility compared to relying solely
          on third-party services. This setup allows for a robust
          environment tailored to my specific needs.</p>
