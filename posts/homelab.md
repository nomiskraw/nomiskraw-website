# My Homelab Network

## What is a Homelab
A homelab is a personal IT environment that allows you to test, experiment, and learn about various technologies. It is usually a home-based setup where you can configure servers, networks, and various services.


1. **Internet**: Represented by the globe at the top, indicating the WAN (Wide Area Network) connection.
2. **Router**: Receives the internet connection and provides both wired and wireless (Wi-Fi) access.
3. **Wireless Laptop**: Thinkpad 470s with Debian 12. Connected to my network via Wi-Fi.
4. **pfSense Firewall**: VM in Proxmox. Acts as the main firewall, managing traffic between the internet and my internal network.
5. **Switch**: TP-Link TL-R470t+. Distributes the network connection to various devices.
6. **Windows Machine**: My main PC for managing my network.
7. **Synology NAS**:  2 x 2To. A Network-Attached Storage device for centralized file storage and backups.
8. **Homelab Server**: Intel NUC Mini PC. Hosts several virtual machines (VMs) and Linux containers (LXC). Each VM/container runs a specific service.

Below are short definitions of each service I'm hosting:

## Services Overview

### VM

1. **Minecraft Server**  
   A dedicated game server hosting Minecraft worlds for multiplayer gameplay. It allows players to connect, build, explore, and collaborate in a shared environment.

2. **Pi-Hole**  
   A network-wide ad blocker and DNS sinkhole solution. It filters out advertising and tracking domains, improving privacy and reducing unwanted content across all devices on the network.

3. **Windows Sandbox**  
   A lightweight, isolated desktop environment provided by Windows. Itâ€™s typically used for testing software or files in a secure environment without affecting the main system.

4. **CasaOS**  
   A simple, community-driven home cloud system for personal data storage, application management, and smart home functions. It provides an easy-to-use web interface for managing services and apps. I'm hosting here Homarr, a dashboard to have all of my services in one place.

### LXC

1. **Zoraxy**  
   A customizable self-hosted proxy service. It allows you to easily manage and secure internal web services, offering features like SSL/TLS termination and authentication.

2. **Jellyfin**  
   An open-source media server that lets you manage and stream your movies, music, and TV shows to various devices.

3. **Portainer**  
   A management UI for Docker (and other container environments). It simplifies the deployment, management, and monitoring of containers through a user-friendly web interface. I'm hosting here Tailscale for reaching my homelab from anywhere.

4. **Vikunja**  
   An open-source task management and to-do list application. It helps organize tasks, projects, and notes.

By hosting these services on my homelab, I gain greater control, privacy, and flexibility compared to relying solely on third-party services. This setup allows for a robust environment tailored to my specific needs.
